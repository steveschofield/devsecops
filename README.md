# DevSecOps

In all transparency, DevOps was a buzz word introduced a few years ago.  IT / Cybersecurity / Technology is like all fields, there are TLA's, buzzwords.  When getting back into Information Security, I focused on DevSecOps.  This is my attempt to share my findings, and understand DevSecOps.  I used to "make fun" of DevSecOps and DevOps terms only to later in my career to become a 'DevSecOps champion'.  

Enjoy,
